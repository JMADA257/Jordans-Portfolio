              Hello, thanks for coming to my portfolio! My name is Jordan Adams,
              and im currently in the process of becoming a web developer.
              Originally I came from a small state, Delaware. at 18 years i
              finished high school and went into the United States Marine Corps
              as a tank operator. I did this for about 3 years before I got out.
              Pretty awesome thing to be able to shoot tanks for a job! After
              that I went back home for a short while before heading to Colorado
              to work at the Ritz-Carlton as a server! I ended up working there
              for about 3 years before I left and became lead bartender at
              Fattoria restaurant, a multi million dollar locally owned
              business! I was in charge of creating the new cocktail menu and
              making sure the bar was kept like a well oiled machine. Finally I
              finished working there after about a year to head to Denver to
              attend the course im currently in for website development! Thats
              about it for me!
            </p>
